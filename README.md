Atliq Hardware is a prominent supplier of computer hardware and peripherals to various esteemed clients, including Surge Stores, Nomad Stores, Excel Stores, and Electricalsara Stores across India. The company's headquarters are based in Delhi, and it operates regional offices spanning different regions of the country. However, the Sales Director of Atliq Hardware is currently facing a series of challenges in light of the rapidly evolving market.

One of the main difficulties the Sales Director is encountering is effectively tracking sales in this dynamic and growing market. The ever-changing landscape poses obstacles in gaining accurate insights into the business performance. Additionally, the Sales Director relies on the regional managers for North, South, and Central India for updates and information. Unfortunately, the data provided by these managers is conveyed verbally during phone conversations, often painting an overly optimistic picture of the sales situation.

This discrepancy between the rosy picture presented and the observable decline in overall sales has left the Sales Director feeling frustrated. Despite requesting specific numbers, the regional managers tend to provide information in numerous excel files, making it challenging for the Sales Director to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

In an effort to make data-driven decisions and boost the company's sales, the Sales Director is seeking a more efficient and transparent solution. Specifically, he desires an interactive dashboard that can present data in a clear, easy-to-understand, and digestible manner. This dashboard would enable him to grasp the complete picture of the company's performance promptly.

By having access to a user-friendly dashboard with real-time data, the Sales Director can make informed decisions that will propel the company's growth in this highly competitive market.
